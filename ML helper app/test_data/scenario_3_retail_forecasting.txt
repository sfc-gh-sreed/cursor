Customer Call Summary - Alpine Outdoor Retail
Date: January 8, 2025
AE: Jennifer Martinez | SE: Tom Wilson
Customer Contacts: Susan Chen (CFO), Brian Rodriguez (Head of Merchandising)

=== COMPANY OVERVIEW ===
- Alpine Outdoor Retail - Regional outdoor gear retailer
- $120M annual revenue, 85 stores across Mountain West region
- Family-owned business, 50 years in operation
- Small data team: 2 business analysts, 1 data analyst
- Current tech stack: Snowflake for data warehouse, Tableau for reporting

=== CURRENT FORECASTING CHALLENGES ===

"We're still doing our demand forecasting in Excel spreadsheets, and it's killing us during peak seasons," - Susan Chen

CURRENT PROCESS:
- Manual Excel-based forecasting by product category
- Brian's team spends 40 hours per week updating forecasts
- Seasonal adjustments based on "gut feel" and historical averages
- Inventory decisions made with 60-day lead times

PAIN POINTS:
1. "Last winter, we were 40% overstocked on ski equipment because our forecast was way off. We had to do deep discounts that crushed our margins." - Brian Rodriguez

2. "Our current forecasting accuracy is about 65%. Industry best practice is 85%+. Better forecasting would improve our gross margin by 3-4 percentage points."

3. "We have 15 years of sales data in Snowflake, but we're not using any of it for predictive modeling. It's just sitting there."

4. "Weather has a huge impact on our sales, but we can't factor that into our Excel models effectively."

=== BUSINESS IMPACT OF POOR FORECASTING ===

CURRENT METRICS:
- Forecasting accuracy: 65%
- Overstock situations: 15-20% of SKUs per season
- Stockout situations: 10-12% of SKUs per season  
- Lost sales due to stockouts: estimated $2.8M annually
- Excess inventory markdowns: $1.9M annually

"If we could get to 85% forecasting accuracy, we'd save $3-4M annually in better inventory management," - Susan Chen

=== SPECIFIC USE CASES ===

**Seasonal Demand Forecasting:**
- Ski equipment (Nov-Mar peak season)
- Hiking/camping gear (Apr-Oct peak season)  
- Hunting equipment (Aug-Dec peak season)
- Need forecasts by store location and product category

**Weather-Based Adjustments:**
- Heavy snowfall = ski equipment spike
- Warm spring = early hiking season
- Summer heat waves = camping gear demand
- "A single big snowstorm can increase ski sales 300% in one week"

**New Store Demand Planning:**
- Opening 3 new stores in 2025
- Need to predict demand without historical data
- Market sizing based on demographics and competitor analysis

=== CURRENT DATA SOURCES ===

ALL DATA ALREADY IN SNOWFLAKE:
- Point-of-sale data (15 years history)
- Inventory levels and turnover rates
- Store location and demographic data
- Supplier lead times and costs
- Historical weather data (considering weather API integration)

"Everything we need is already in Snowflake. We just need a way to build forecasting models without hiring a data science team," - Susan Chen

=== TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ===

CONSTRAINTS:
- No dedicated data science resources
- Must work with existing Snowflake investment
- Business analysts need to understand and maintain models
- Can't afford complex ML infrastructure
- Results must be explainable to merchandising team

DESIRED CAPABILITIES:
- Automated weekly forecast updates
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Weather factor integration
- Store clustering based on performance patterns
- Alert system for significant forecast changes

=== BUSINESS CONTEXT ===

"We're competing with big box retailers and online players. Our advantage is local market knowledge and personalized service, but we need better inventory management to stay competitive," - Brian Rodriguez

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE:
- REI and Dick's Sporting Goods expanding into their markets
- Online retailers (Amazon, Backcountry) taking market share  
- Need to maintain 95%+ in-stock rates on popular items
- Margins under pressure - can't afford excess inventory

=== DECISION CRITERIA ===

"We need a solution that works with our existing Snowflake setup and doesn't require hiring expensive data scientists," - Susan Chen

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must integrate seamlessly with Snowflake
2. Business users can understand and modify forecasts
3. Implementation in < 30 days
4. Cost under $50K annually for software/consulting
5. Proven ROI within 6 months

=== TIMELINE ===
- Need solution implemented before spring buying season (March 2025)
- Budget approved for FY2025
- Success will drive expansion to other analytical use cases
- Considering Tableau integration for forecast visualization

=== KEY QUOTES ===

"We're not trying to build Netflix-level recommendation engines. We just want accurate demand forecasts that help us buy the right inventory for each store." - Brian Rodriguez

"Our data is clean and ready in Snowflake. We need ML that works with what we have, not a whole new platform." - Susan Chen

"If we can nail demand forecasting, that opens the door for customer analytics, pricing optimization, and other advanced use cases." - Susan Chen
